## What is Fastly VCL?

Fastly VCL (Varnish Configuration Language) is a domain-specific language used to configure Fastly's edge cloud platform. It's based on the open-source Varnish Cache language but includes Fastly-specific extensions and features.

With Fastly VCL, you can:

- Control how requests and responses are processed
- Define caching behavior
- Implement content-based routing
- Perform edge-based transformations
- Implement security policies
- And much more
